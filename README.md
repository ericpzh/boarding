# B737-800 Boarding Simulation

Comparing different boarding order v.s. total time needed for B737-800

Visualization is provided with blue -> passengers. To create .gif, save picture in desire reflesh rate and use GIF creaters.

Custom random numbers, shuffling method are applied

This is a dynamic discrete event stimulation model of a boarding process of B738. This project stimulates different boarding orders in order to find out the optimal boarding process. The pictures and gif are generated by python codes taking snapshots during the stimulation process. Check out the code: github.com/ericpzh/boarding/
